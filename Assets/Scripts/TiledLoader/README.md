# TiledLoader

## About
TiledLoader is a Unity editor extension which supports loading Tiled Map Editor files
into Unity. It allows Unity prefabs to be linked to tiles and objects in Tiled in an easy 
and intuitive way, and instantiated in Unity according to the layout of the Tiled map. 
The way prefabs are instantiated can be further configured through the use of Tiled Custom 
Properties.

## Usage
Clone TiledLoader into a directory within your Unity project's Assets directory. 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/branderson/TiledLoader.git
```
In Unity, click on Window/TiledLoader to open the TiledLoader window.
